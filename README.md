# Abstract React Component
An abstract React Component for TypeScript meant to be used to enable real life testing of components in their true form.

## Usage
Bring a copy of [the class](./src/index.tsx) into your project (TypeScript will not be happy importing a compiled version).

## Example
See [this test](./test/unit/index.tsx).
